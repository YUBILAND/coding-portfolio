This is my coding portfolio website where I showcase the projects I have worked on so far.

Website:

[david-chen.org](https://david-chen.org)

I used GitHub pages because my tech portfolio is just a static front-end page with redirects.
The custom domain comes from Cloudflare.
I used subdomains to show my projects that are hosted on AWS EC2 instances.

-> [wordle.david-chen.org](https://wordle.david-chen.org)

-> [apple.david-chen.org](https://apple.david-chen.org)

As for the design of the website, its very basic for now. I'm going to continue adding more to the website until it is fleshed out. 


## Design

At the moment, its very basic.

I've only created a header, a intro, and project section with redirects.

I'm going to continue adding more to the website until it is fleshed out.
